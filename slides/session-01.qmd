## Overview

::: box-note
**Why**

-   Quantitative data analysis in linguistics is increasingly requiring more sophisticated techniques.

-   Software used in the past (Excel, SPSS) is no longer sufficient.
:::

. . .

::: box-tip
**What**

-   You will learn the basics of R.

-   This is not a crash course in statistics.

## Programming: variables

::: box-tip
A (programming) **variable** assigns a value to a name.
:::

. . .

<br>

```{r}
age <- 36
name <- "Stefano"
```

. . .

```{r}
age
```

. . .

```{r}
age <- 82
age
```


## Programming: functions

::: box-tip
A **function** runs an operation on one or more specified **arguments**.

A function in R has the form `function()` where:

-   `function` is the name of the function, like `sum`.
-   `()` are round parentheses, inside of which you write arguments, separated by commas.
:::

. . .

<br>

```{r}
sum(3, 3)

beans <- c(5, 10)
mean(beans)
```

## Files and file paths

::: box-tip
**File paths** are strings of text that indicate where a file is saved on the hard disk of your computer.

**Folders** (aka directories) are separated by a slash (`/`) in file paths.
:::

. . . 

<br>

```
/ste/Documents/dissertation/data/questionnaire.csv
```

## Reading data in R

::: box-tip
**Relative file paths** are paths that are relative to a working directory.
:::

. . .

<br>

``` r
questionnaire <- read_csv("./data/questionnaire.csv")
```

## Tutorial

::: box-warning
- Form small groups (2-3 students) with students sitting next to you.

- Go to XXX and work together on the "Session 1" tutorial.
