You can upload files to the server through RStudio to be able to read them in R and process them further.\nIn this tutorial, we will use data from Brentari et al 2024. This study looked at the organization of verb meaning in Lengua de Señas Nicaragüense (LSN). Here’s the abstract (feel free to check out the paper if you would like to know more about the study).\n\nOne structural dimension that varies across languages is the simultaneous or sequential expression of meaning. Complex predicates can layer meanings together simultaneously in a single-verb predicate (SVP) or distribute them sequentially in a multiple-verb predicate (MVP). We ask whether typological variability in this dimension might be a consequence of systematic patterns of diachronic change. We examine the distribution of markers of agency and number within the verb phrase (the predicate) in the earliest stages of a young, emerging sign language in Nicaragua, Lengua de Señas Nicaragüense (LSN), beginning with homesign systems like those from which LSN originated, and progressing through two decades of transmission to new learners. We find that: (i) LSN2 signers are more likely to produce MVPs than homesigners or LSN1 signers; (ii) in the MVPs they do produce, homesigners and LSN1 signers are more likely to produce predicates that mark both agency and number simultaneously on at least one of the verbs; LSN2 signers are just as likely to produce sequences with verbs that mark agency and number in sequentially separate verbs. We discuss how language acquisition, modality, and structure, as well as specific social factors associated with each of the groups, play a role in driving these changes, and how, over time, these patterns of change might yield the diversity of forms observed across spoken and signed languages today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n\n\nFirst, download the ZIP archive containing the data to be uploaded (the ZIP also has other data you will use later).

    "title": "Session 1",
    "section": "Obtain counts from the data",
    "text": "Obtain counts from the data\nA very common step in quantitative data analysis is to get counts for different things in the data.\nThe most basic count is just how many observations there are in the data: this count is simply the number of rows in the data. You can see the number of rows next to the data name in the Environment tab: they are called “observations”. The verb_org data has 630 observations.\nThere is also R code that can return the number of rows/observations. This is the count() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following code to the script.\n\ncount(verb_org)\n\nRun the code\n\n\n\nHere is the code again, with the output you will see in the Console after you run the code.\n\ncount(verb_org)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      n\n  &lt;int&gt;\n1   630\n\n\nThe number printed in the console is 630, the number of rows in the data.\nThe count() function simply counts the number of rows in the data you specify within parenthesis. Here, we put verb_org so the function simply returns the number of rows in that data.\nBut count() is not limited to that. It can also count the number of rows depending on values in columns in the data. For example, we can count the number of rows depending on the Group column.\nThis column has three possible values: homesign (for signers that learnt signing at home), NSL1 (for fist-generation signers that learnt from homesigners) and NSL2 (for second-generation signers that learnt from first-generation signers).\nTo obtain the number of rows in the data based on Group you can simply specify the Group coloumn, like so:\n\n# Note the comma\ncount(verb_org, Group)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  Group        n\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1 NSL1       237\n2 NSL2       208\n3 homesign   185\n\n\nA table is printed, with two columns:\n\nGroup with the group value.\nn with the number of rows for each group.\n\nWhat if we want to know the number of rows per participants? There is catch with this data: the column Participant contains participant IDs, but alas the authors re-used IDs across groups. So there is a participant 1 for homesigners, NSL-1 and NSL-2.\nTo be able to count the rows per actual participants, we need to specify both the Group column and the Participant column, like so:\n\ncount(verb_org, Group, Participant)\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 3\n   Group    Participant     n\n   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n 1 NSL1               1    50\n 2 NSL1               2    62\n 3 NSL1               3    63\n 4 NSL1               4    62\n 5 NSL2               1    47\n 6 NSL2               2    45\n 7 NSL2               3    54\n 8 NSL2               4    62\n 9 homesign           1    35\n10 homesign           2    32\n11 homesign           3    57\n12 homesign           4    61\n\n\nYou can see that there are four participants in each group (participant 1, 2, 3, 4). Some participants have more observations than others.\nNow try it yourself, write code to get the number of rows within each group depending on the value of Num_Predicates. This column has two values: single for single predicate, and multiple for multiple predicates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should list both columns in the count() function, separated by a comma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nAre you sure you have tried it yourself firt?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, show me!\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncount(verb_org, Group, Num_Predicates)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Group    Num_Predicates     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n1 NSL1     multiple          45\n2 NSL1     single           192\n3 NSL2     multiple         103\n4 NSL2     single           105\n5 homesign multiple          67\n6 homesign single           118\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo these are the count of observations by number of predicates for each group.\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  Group    Num_Predicates     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n1 NSL1     multiple          45\n2 NSL1     single           192\n3 NSL2     multiple         103\n4 NSL2     single           105\n5 homesign multiple          67\n6 homesign single           118\n\n\nIt is interesting to note that homesigners have a higher number of single predicates cases than multiple predicate cases (118 vs 67). The difference between single and multiple predicates increases in NSL-1 signers (192 vs 45), but it drops again in NSL-2 signers, where it is basically 50-50 (105 vs 103)!\nCounting is a powerful statistical tool and R makes it so easy!"

    "section": "Plotting data in R",
    "text": "Plotting data in R\nThis week you will learn how to create simple plots of the Brentari 2024 data you worked with last week. Then, you will practice what you learnt with a new data!\nThe tidyverse package ggplot2 provides users with a consistent set of functions to create captivating graphics.\nSince ggplot2 is part of the tidyverse, when you attach the tidyverse with library(tidyverse), the ggplot2 package is also attached, so you don’t have to attach it directly.\nGo to the script you created last time and re-run all the code to attach the tidyverse packages and read the data in R.\nLet’s create a simple plot with the number of observation per number of predicates (single vs multiple) in the three signers groups. We will build the plot one layer at a time so that you can understand what each line does (but note that normally you would just create the plot in one go). Here’s the final plot: this is known as a “bar chart”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we need data and some axes.\n\nggplot(verb_org, aes(x = Num_Predicates))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a plot you need:\n\nThe ggplot() function.\nThe data to use as the first argument to the ggplot function.\nThe “aesthetics” to include in the plot, with the aes() function.\n\nHere, we want an x-axis with multiple and single predicate numbers. Hence x = Num_predicates (that’s the name of the column in the data and x = says it has to be the x-axis).\nWrite the code in your script and run it. The plot will appear in the “Plots” tab of the bottom-right panel of RStudio.\nNow, let’s add bars with the counts (we will split by Group later).\n\nggplot(verb_org, aes(x = Num_Predicates)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s easy! You just add + geom_bar() (for bar geometry). Don’t forget the + at the end of the first line! Geometries are visual elements of the plots that represent data, here the counts of observations of multiple and single predicates. You don’t have to make the count yourself, geom_bar() counts things for you and generates the bars. The y-axis is the counts.\nSo, based on the plot there are a total of a bit more than 200 multiple predicates and a bit more than 400 single predicates. This is interesting by itself: single predicates are more common than multiple predicates, overall.\nNow let’s split the data depending on the group of signers (home-signers, first generation, second generation). To do this, we can use “facetting”, which creates separate panels in the plot.\n\nggplot(verb_org, aes(x = Num_Predicates)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(Group))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facet_grid() function allows you to facet the plot into panels. It takes either a cols argument or a rows argument. Here we wanted the panels to be arranged in columns, rather than rows, so we used the cols argument. The argument takes a column from the data to split panels by: here, we specified Group. Note that you need to enclose the column in the vars() function (don’t worry as to why).\nFeel free to try and use rows instead of cols and see what the difference is.\nWe are almost there! While colour is not really necessary to distinguish multiple vs single predicates because they are already shown on the x-axis, colour can facilitate comparison (but don’t overdo it!). Changing colours in plots might not seem straightforward to beginners, so here you will just learn how to change the colour as per the plot above, but to really understand what the code is doing, you will have to dive in Chapter 1 of R for Data Science.\n\nggplot(verb_org, aes(x = Num_Predicates, fill = Num_Predicates)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(Group))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColours are considered “asthetics” elements because the map data to aesthetic aspects of the plot. Here, colour is mapped into number of predicates. ggplot has default colours that are selected for you, but you can customise them. As mentioned above, customisation is not that straightforward to beginners so here I will just show you the code without going into the details. To understand in more details, you will have to learn more about ggplot2.\n\nggplot(verb_org, aes(Num_Predicates, fill = Num_Predicates)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(Group)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\") selects a qualitative scale from ColorBrewer2 to fill the bars. (You can check the documentation of specific functions by running the function name preceded by ? in the console: for example ?scale_fill_brewer).\nWe can also customise the labels of the axes, using the labs() function.\n\nggplot(verb_org, aes(Num_Predicates, fill = Num_Predicates)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(Group)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\") +\n  labs(x = \"Predicate type\", y = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the label of the x-axis, you use the x argument followed by = and a string with the text for the label: x = \"Predicate type\". To change the y-axis label, you do the same but with the y argument.\nNow, the last step is to remove the legend. We don’t really need the legend because the colour doesn’t add to what we already know from the axes.\n\nggplot(verb_org, aes(Num_Predicates, fill = Num_Predicates)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(Group)) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe theme() function allows you to change some aspects of the plot, among which the position of the legend. When the position is set to \"none\", then the legend is not shown.\nYou might want to export the plot to include it in your dissertation or paper. You can click on the Export button in the Plots tab and select Image or PDF. A window opens with some settings for you to choose (ask me if you are unsure about what they do).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you click “Save” the file is saved on the server: go to the Files tab and you should see your plot listed among the files. If you click on the plot file, the plot will be opened in the Browser and you can download it to your computer."

    "text": "Practice\nNow you can practice reading data in R, counting observations and plotting using a different data set: coretta2022/glot_status.rds.\nYou might have noticed that the file with the data glot_status.rds is not a .csv file, but an .rds file. This is a special file format used with R.\nTo read an .rds file you use the readRDS() function, like so.\n\nglot_status &lt;- readRDS(\"data/coretta2022/glot_status.rds\")\n\nDon’t worry about what .rds files actually are, just that they contain data and that you can read them with readRDS()!\nYou should view the data now that it’s imported in R.\nHere you can find a description of the columns in the glot_status data: Glottolog 4.6 data: Agglomerated Endangerment Status. The data is a list of languages of the world with their Agglomerated Endangerment Status (an index of endangerment). This information is contained in the status column.\n\n\n# A tibble: 8,345 × 2\n   Name                   status  \n   &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;fct&gt;   \n 1 Kol (Papua New Guinea) shifting\n 2 Tanahmerah             shifting\n 3 Touo                   shifting\n 4 Berta                  shifting\n 5 Siuslaw                extinct \n 6 Jalaa                  extinct \n 7 Elseng                 shifting\n 8 Taiap                  moribund\n 9 Pyu                    shifting\n10 Mato Grosso Arára      extinct \n# ℹ 8,335 more rows\n\n\nTry to count the number of languages. The following instructions give you examples of a few things that you can count in the data but feel free to explore the data further (ask me any questions about the columns if it’s not clear what they are).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n\n\n\nCount the total number of observations.\nCount the number of languages by status.\nCount the number of languages by macro-area.\nCount the number of languages by status, by macro-area.\n\n\n\nNow that you checked some counts, you can try to plot the data! If you need some inspiration and a challenge, here is a plot you could try to reconstruct yourself using what you learnt above.\nThe following is a “stacked” bar chart. It’s stacked because the bars of different colour (i.e. different status) are stacked on top of each other. You can create a stacked bar chart using the fill argument. Can you figure out how? There are a couple hints below but feel free to ask for more directions!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacroarea is the x-axis.\nThe bars are filled by status."

    "text": "Conclusion\nFantastic job! You should pat yourself on the shoulders. In just two short sessions you have learnt quite a lot! Of course, to be proficient in using R for data analysis you will have to put in a lot more work (years of practice, really!).\nIf you feel that you do want to learn more, then I recommend the R for Data Science book. It’s great for beginners and it covers all the basics of reading, summarising and plotting data in R.\nIt does not cover statistics per se. If you would like to learn more about statistics too, the best place is look at the materials of the Quantitative Methods course in LEL. Of course, feel free to reach out to Stefano (s.coretta@ed.ac.uk) for further suggestions."
